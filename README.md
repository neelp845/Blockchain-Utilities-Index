# Blockchain Utilities Index (BLKU)

## Introduction

This project was completed as part of the coursework for the Indexing & ETF class during our Master's in Quantitative Finance degree. The project, carried out by four team members—Cameron Raughtigan, Gurpreet Singh, Neel Patel, and Paridnya Kapse—focuses on the creation and analysis of a crypto-based utility index.

## Overview

The Blockchain Utilities Index (BLKU) aims to capture the performance of blockchain and cryptocurrency assets that offer unique utilities beyond simple store-of-value or payment functionalities. This index emphasizes tokens with specific use cases and intrinsic values driven by their respective blockchain technologies.

## Detailed Content

### Index Introduction

The adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is rapidly increasing, driven by institutional investments and expanding venture capital allocations. Our index focuses on the utility of blockchain tokens, which often remain overshadowed by top market cap coins. By allocating based on token utility, the index aims to better encapsulate the growth potential within the digital asset class.

### Overall Crypto Adoption

According to Chainalysis, global crypto adoption has grown by over 2300% since Q3 2019 and over 881% from Q2 2020 to Q2 2021. This growth has been significantly powered by institutional investments in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia.

### Venture Capital Allocations

Galaxy Digital reports that crypto/blockchain startups received nearly 5% of venture capital deployed in 2021, with allocations predominantly in DeFi (41%) and NFT, Web3, DAO, and Metaverse-related projects (17%).

### Utility of Digital Assets

Utility in digital assets refers to rights granted in exchange for ownership, solving societal problems currently addressed by centralized parties, and providing potential intrinsic value. These utilities can be immediate or future-oriented, distinguishing them from security tokens and fiat currencies.

### Constituent Selection Criteria

- Tradable on a U.S. exchange
- Unique exposure and decentralized
- Minimum $10mm 24-hour trading volume over three consecutive rebalance days
- Single token weight < 20%
- Tokens with > 5% weight < 50% of the index
- Each theme has 2-10 tokens

### Exclusions

- USD pegged tokens (do not provide exposure to cryptocurrencies)
- Centralized exchanges (exposure can be gained via equity shares like Coinbase)
- Derivatives (exposures match underlying assets exactly)

### Utility Themes of Digital Assets

The index categorizes digital assets into high, mid, and low growth based on their utility themes.

### Liquidity Constraint

Minimum $10mm volume on the last day of the month for three consecutive months.

### ETF Replication Constraints

**Single Issuer Constraint:** No tokens with a weight greater than 25%.

**Diversification Rule:** Historically low market capitalization and volume limited diversification, but recent growth has increased potential candidates. The index meets ETF replication standards.

### Token Weights Calculation

Rebalancing occurs monthly following a specific methodology to ensure optimal representation of the index constituents.

### State of the Index Q1 2022

The top 10 coins make up 66% of the index, with ETH, BTC, and DOT being the largest three positions.

### Historical Performance

Newly developed tokens with unique utilities propelled the index's performance in 2021. The index demonstrated clear outperformance against market cap indexes before June 2021.

### Bias Considerations

The current token selection represents contemporary themes, many of which developed over the past two years. The initial backtest included largely cash utility tokens.

### Comparison to Market Cap Indexes

Before June 2021, the index showed significant outperformance. Post-June 2021, the performance aligned more closely with market cap indexes, reflecting similar trends.

## Conclusion

The Blockchain Utilities Index (BLKU) provides a nuanced approach to evaluating the potential of blockchain assets, focusing on utility rather than market cap dominance. This methodology aims to highlight growth areas within the digital asset space, offering valuable insights for investors and stakeholders.
